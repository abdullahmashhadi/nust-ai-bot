The term ‘Foreign Students’ is used at NUST on Qalam and in other \ncommunications refers to students enrolled through SAT-based admissions, which may \nalso include some national candidates. To prevent confusion, the term ‘International \nStudents’ will be specifically used to refer to Non-Pakistani candidates who require visa \nto study in Pakistan. \n2. The current tuition fee for international students for MS & PhD was kept the same \nas that for domestic students which is considerably lower than that of some of our \ncompetitor universities in other countries. The decision to keep the fee low aimed at \nattracting international students, but the extent to which this adjustment has contributed \nto an increase in international student enrollments remains uncertain. On the other hand,",

Moreover, many international universities provide bursaries, discounts on fees and \nwaive off application processing fee to encourage international enrollments, to develop \nbilateral ties with friendly countries, human resource development of developing \ncountries. Scholarships are also used as a marketing tool to attract international \napplicants. Given NUST’s already lower fee, it is challenging to offer additional discounts. \nKeeping above in view, it was needed that tuition fee for Master & PhD program to be \nincreased to match those of the top-ranked universities in our competitor countries \nenabling NUST provide substantial discounts and scholarships.",

To increase international student enrollment while keeping the marketing and \noutreach costs low, NUST is exploring the option of offering reward-based referral system \nand collaborating with student recruitment agencies in the targeted countries. \n5. Additionally, International Students who wish to study at NUST often are unable to \njoin the semester on time due to delays in visa processing and HEC NOC (No Objection \nCertificate) issues.
