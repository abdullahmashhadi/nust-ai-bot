To  this  end,  the \nactivities  of  clubs  and  societies play  a significant role in students’ personality development. \nStudents carry positive traits of initiative, energy, and exuberance that need to be harnessed and \nmentored  to  ensure that their activities  are geared towards the key objective of personality \ndevelopment. \n3.",

Grooming  of  students  based  on  our  cultural  ethos, religious  values,  social norms, \ndiversity, tolerance, and empathy. On the whole, instilling virtues and values as an \nessential  element  of  personality  development should  be  at  the core of  all \nactivities. \nc. Activities aligned with SDGs and our corporate social responsibilities. \nd. Activities should be led by and participated in by maximum students. \ne. Focus on quality and not quantity of events.

As  per  frequency  of \nevents of 41 Clubs & Societies, more than one event is planned on each working day \nand  its  intimate  monitoring  by  the  concerned faculty  sponsor  is  a  pre-requisite  to \nguarantee that the event follows the laid down parameters.  \ng.",
