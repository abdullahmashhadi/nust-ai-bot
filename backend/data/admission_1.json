The signature with positioning statement ‘Defining futures’ is to be used with posters, magazine, brochures, flyers, streamers, standees and billboards. This can also be used for branding advertisements. No-branding print advertisements are used to provide the readers with a particular piece of information, such as Admission Ads, Employment Ads, Expression of Interest Ads, Tender Ads, and Conference/ Seminar/ Workshop/ Symposium Ads. Branding print advertisements are used to strengthen and improve the overall image of an entity and do not necessarily contain any particular piece of information for readers. REPRODUCING THE SIGNATURE The rules shown in this section will ensure that the signature is always presented in a consistent and clear way. Whenever the signature is used, it should be presented in such a way that it is immediately recognized.",

Use only if black cannot be used. Under no circumstances is tampering allowed with the NUST Signature. Some usual mistakes are mentioned here that can be termed as tampering. The standard size appears on all quarter page branding and non-branding print advertisements, fliers and brochures at a width of 30 mm. The size may be increased proportionately, for instance, in a half page advertisement, it may be doubled to 60 mm, and so forth. The signature may be proportionately scaled to a minimum width of 17 mm, where space constraints mean the standard size signature may not be used.",

For even larger media such as billboards/ hoardings the size can be increased from the standard size to match the need. The signature may be proportionally scaled to a minimum size of 6 in. for use where space constraints may mean the standard size may not be used. As a general rule, in order to maintain its integrity, when the signature is presented in its standard form in stationery and electronic applications, a clear space equal to the height of the rising sun – the exclusion zone – must be left. Also, other graphic elements, such as photographs, illustrations or typography should not interfere or encroach on the exclusion zone. If you refer to the examples shown on pages 8 and 9 the exclusion parameters were used to maintain the integrity of the signature.",
